# This script takes data from the US Census 5-year American Community Survey,
# which, in this case, have been saved into two files, "2000.csv" and "2014.json",
# and cross-references them against a list of zip codes tabulation areas that
# relate to the cities we are analyzing.

# ZCTA's I had to throw out because they weren't represented in both data sets:
# - 97239
# - 97208
# - 97086
# - 94613
# - 94158
# - 78712

# The 2000 Census data coudl be found at:
# http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml

# The API call that produced the data in the 2014 JSON file is:
# - http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs5?get=B19013_001E&for=zip+code+tabulation+area

# The meanings of the census code in the API call is:
# - 'B19013_001E' = 'Median household income'

# This comes from the ACS variable dictionary:
# http://api.census.gov/data/2013/acs5/variables.html
